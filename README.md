<h3>Wind Condition Checker for Dahab Lagoon</h3>

This Python script is designed to retrieve the current weather conditions for Dahab Lagoon using the OpenWeather free API. <br>
It is scheduled to run every morning on my Synology NAS to retrieve the weather conditions for the current day. <br>
It checks if the wind conditions are suitable for windsurfing and sends a message accordingly. <br>
If the conditions are favorable, it will recommend going windsurfing; otherwise, it will suggest alternative activities.<br>

Please note that this script relies on the accuracy of the OpenWeather API for weather data. Use the information provided by this script at your own discretion. <br>
Feel free to modify and enhance the script to suit your specific needs and preferences. Happy windsurfing! 🏄‍♂️🌊
